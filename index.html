            <p>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day.

The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story</p>
